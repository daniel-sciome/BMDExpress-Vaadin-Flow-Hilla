# Session 13 Part 3: Table Bulk Selection UI (Phase 7)

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Continuation of:** Session 13 Parts 1-2 (Master Filter, UMAP Integration, Selection State)

## Overview
Implemented Phase 7 (Table Reactivity Enhancements) from the FILTERING_AND_REACTIVITY_PLAN. Added visible UI for bulk selection operations using the infrastructure built in Phase 3.

## Phase 7: Table Reactivity Enhancements ✅

### Goal
Add user-facing bulk selection controls to the table with selection counter and action buttons.

### What Was Implemented

#### 1. Updated Redux Actions (`categoryResultsSlice.ts`)

**Modified `selectAllCategories` action:**
- Now accepts optional `string[]` parameter for specific category IDs
- If no parameter provided, selects all data (backward compatible)
- **Key behavior:** Component passes filtered IDs to operate only on visible categories

```typescript
selectAllCategories: (state, action: PayloadAction<string[] | undefined>) => {
  const idsToSelect = action.payload || state.data.map(...);
  state.selectedCategoryIds = new Set(idsToSelect);
}
```

**Modified `invertSelection` action:**
- Now accepts optional `string[]` parameter for scope
- Inverts selection only within provided IDs
- **Key behavior:** Component passes filtered IDs to invert only visible categories

```typescript
invertSelection: (state, action: PayloadAction<string[] | undefined>) => {
  const allIds = action.payload || state.data.map(...);
  // Invert within allIds only
}
```

#### 2. Updated CategoryResultsGrid Component

**Added Imports:**
- `Tag` component from Ant Design
- Icons: `CheckSquareOutlined`, `CloseSquareOutlined`, `SwapOutlined`
- Actions: `selectAllCategories`, `clearSelection`, `invertSelection`
- Selectors: `selectIsAnythingSelected`, `selectSelectedCount`

**Added Selection State:**
```typescript
const isAnythingSelected = useAppSelector(selectIsAnythingSelected);
const selectedCount = useAppSelector(selectSelectedCount);
```

**Added Bulk Selection Handlers:**
```typescript
const handleSelectAll = () => {
  // Get visible IDs (after Master Filter + hideRowsWithoutBMD)
  const visibleIds = data.map(cat => cat.categoryId).filter(Boolean);
  dispatch(selectAllCategories(visibleIds));
};

const handleInvertSelection = () => {
  const visibleIds = data.map(cat => cat.categoryId).filter(Boolean);
  dispatch(invertSelection(visibleIds));
};

const handleClearSelection = () => {
  dispatch(clearSelection());
};
```

**Added UI Elements:**

1. **Selection Counter Tag** (conditionally shown):
   - Displays: "Selected: X of Y"
   - Only appears when something is selected
   - Blue color for visibility
   - Shows count relative to filtered data

2. **Bulk Action Button Group** (`Space.Compact`):
   - **Select All Button:**
     - Icon: CheckSquareOutlined
     - Action: Selects all visible categories
     - Always enabled
     - Tooltip: "Select all visible categories"

   - **Invert Button:**
     - Icon: SwapOutlined
     - Action: Inverts selection within visible categories
     - Disabled when nothing selected
     - Tooltip: "Invert selection"

   - **Clear Button:**
     - Icon: CloseSquareOutlined
     - Action: Clears all selection
     - Disabled when nothing selected
     - Red/danger styling
     - Tooltip: "Clear selection"

### UI Layout

Table header now contains (left to right):
1. Title: "Category Results (X categories)"
2. **Selection Counter Tag** (when selected) ← NEW
3. **Bulk Action Buttons** (Select All, Invert, Clear) ← NEW
4. "Hide rows without BMD" checkbox
5. "Configure Columns" button

### Key Design Decisions

#### 1. Master Filter Independence
**Critical:** Bulk selection operates ONLY on filtered data, NOT on Master Filter
- `data` variable contains categories after Master Filter is applied
- `handleSelectAll` and `handleInvertSelection` use `data`, not `allData`
- Master Filter settings are NEVER modified by selection operations
- Selection and filtering are completely independent systems

#### 2. Filtered Data Scope
Bulk actions operate on currently visible categories:
- After Master Filter (percentage, genes passed, all genes)
- After "Hide rows without BMD" toggle
- Does NOT include filtered-out categories

**Flow:**
```
Raw Data → Master Filter → Filtered Data → Hide BMD toggle → Visible Data
                                                                    ↓
                                                            Selection operates here
```

#### 3. Button States
- **Select All:** Always enabled (can select even if already selected)
- **Invert & Clear:** Disabled when nothing selected (prevents no-op clicks)
- **Clear:** Styled as danger to indicate destructive action

#### 4. Compact Button Group
Used `Space.Compact` for visual grouping:
- Buttons visually connected
- Shows they're related operations
- Saves horizontal space

### Benefits

**For Users:**
- Quick bulk operations without clicking every row
- Visual feedback showing selection count
- Intuitive icons and tooltips
- Button states prevent confusion

**For Workflow:**
- Select all filtered categories for export
- Invert to quickly select "everything except these few"
- Clear to start fresh selection

**Technical:**
- Uses Phase 3 infrastructure (no duplicate logic)
- Respects filter boundaries (Master Filter independent)
- Type-safe with Redux actions
- Accessible with tooltips and disabled states

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] "Select All" selects all visible categories (after Master Filter)
- [ ] "Select All" works with "Hide rows without BMD" enabled
- [ ] "Invert" correctly flips selection within visible categories
- [ ] "Clear" removes all selections
- [ ] Selection counter shows correct count
- [ ] Buttons disable/enable appropriately
- [ ] Master Filter is NOT affected by selection operations
- [ ] Changing Master Filter preserves selections if categories still visible
- [ ] Manual checkbox selection still works
- [ ] UMAP selection still takes precedence (existing behavior)

## What's Next

### Completed Phases:
✅ Phase 1: Master Filter Component

- Create `useChartSelection` hook
- Foundation for all chart highlighting/dimming

**Phase 5-6: Update Individual Charts** (3 days)
- Apply reactivity to 9 chart components
- Implement highlighting/dimming based on selection
- Add click-to-select functionality

**Phase 8: Performance Optimization** (1 day)
- Memoization review
- Debouncing for rapid operations
- Performance testing

**Phase 9: Testing & Polish** (1 day)
- Comprehensive interaction testing
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+A, Esc)
- Animation transitions
- Export selected categories

## Session Outcome

✅ Phase 7 complete with visible UX improvements
✅ Bulk selection UI added to table header
✅ Selection counter shows real-time feedback
✅ Master Filter independence maintained
✅ All operations work on filtered data only

**Ready for user testing** - Phase 7 provides immediate value with bulk operations.

**Next recommended:** Phase 4 (Chart Reactivity Infrastructure) to enable chart interactions.
